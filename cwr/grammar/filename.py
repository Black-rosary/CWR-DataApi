"""
CWR file name grammar.

This stores grammar for parsing the CWR file name.

As the file name is a very precise type of string, this parsing will be lossless, meaning that all the information
from the file name will be always parsed into the resulting object.

CWR file names follow the pattern CWyynnnnsss_rrr.Vxx, where each section means the following:
CW - Header indicating it is a CWR file.
yy - Year.
nnnn - Sequence. This was originally 2 numbers, later changed to 4.
sss - Sender. 2 or 3 digits.
rrr - Receiver. 2 or 3 digits.
xx - Version of the CWR standard (version x.x).

There are two parsing patterns offered, one for the new format and one for the old.

Filename fields.

These fields are:

- Sender. 2 or 3 alphanumeric characters.
- Receiver. 2 or 3 alphanumeric characters.
- Version Number. 2 digits float (one value for integer, one for decimal).

Each of these fields is parsed into a value as follows:
