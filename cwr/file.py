"""
CWR file structure and information model.

These classes represent a CWR file. This consists on two parts: the metadata on the filename and data inside the file.

The file data is stored into groups, which then are stored into a single transmission. Both of these structures contain
a header and a trailer record, which serve not only to mark the beginning and end of them, but also, in the case of the
trailer records, to validate the previous rows.

Being these four header and trailer records, called control records, are Transmission Header (HDR), Transmission Trailer
(TRL), Group Header (GRH) and Group Trailer (GRT).

These are grouped into a single transmission composed by several groups: [HDR, [GRH,GRT]*, TRL].

Additionally to the internal data structure this module allows to represent the file's metadata, stored according to the
standard in the file name, with FileTag, which stores the information used to identify and differentiate CWR files.
