"""
CWR file structure and information model.

Classes inside this module represent the control records of a CWR file, which are used to partition and control the
structure of these files.

These records ensure the integrity of the file after being transmitted over telecommunication lines, and also confirm
that the data has not suffered any other kind of tampering, may it be intentional or not.

Four of them are used on CWR v2.1: Transmission Header (HDR), Transmission Trailer (TRL), Group Header (GRH) and Group
Trailer (GRT). Each represented by the TransmissionHeader, TransmissionTrailer, GroupHeader and GroupTrailer classes.

With these divisions a file can be considered a single transmission composed by several groups: [HDR, [GRH,GRT]*, TRL].

It is important to know that while there can be multiple groups each should contain a single type of transaction,
and all transactions of the same type should be on the same group.

So if the file contains NWR transactions all of the should be on a single group, which can not contain any other type
of transaction. Just to remark this, no other group on that file should contain NWR transactions.

A fifth class related to the file structure, RecordPrefix, stores the information each row contains at their
beginning, indicating their type and position in the records sequence. As this combination of data is unique for
each prefix, it can be considered to be a Record's identifier.

This is to be used along the abstract class Record, to create any kind of CWR file record.

Additionally to the internal data structure this module allows to represent the file's metadata, stored according to the
standard in the file name, with FileTag, which stores the information used to identify and differentiate CWR files.
