"""
CWR file groups model.

This consists on the Group Header (GRH) and Group Trailer (GRT).

These represent groups inside a CWR file or transmission. These serve two purposes: first they group together
all the transactions of a kind, and second they serve to check the integrity of the data.

The Group Header indicates which type of Transaction will be stored inside the group, while the Group Trailer indicates
how many transactions and records should be inside the Group, as measure to avoid tampering.

It is important to note again that while there can be multiple groups each should contain a single type of transaction,
and all transactions of the same type should be on the same group.

So if the group contains NWR transactions all of the should be on a single group, which can not contain any other type
of transaction. Just to remark this, no other group on that file should contain NWR transactions.
