"""
Base classes for implementing decoder parsers.

A decoder parser receives a data structure and returns an instance of a class from the domain model.

For example, it may receive a JSON and return a CWRFile instance.

All decoders are expected to implement the Decoder interface. This offers a single method which receives the data to
decode, and returns an equivalent model class instance.

Additionally, two decoders for handling grammar rules are included:
- GrammarDecoder, which decodes a string applying a Pyparsing grammar rule.
- GrammarFileDecoder, an extension of the previous decoder meant to work with files.

Note that in the context of the project these parsers are expected to be lossfull. Not all the data in the CWR files
is useful, some rows contains information which can be safely ignored, but also they may parse sources, such as JSON
structures, where additional and unneeded data has been added.
