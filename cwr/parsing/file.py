CWR file parsing classes.

These classes allow decoding and encoding file related information, such as the file name.

CWR file names follow the pattern CWyynnnnsss_rrr.Vxx, where each section means the following:
CW - Header indicating it is a CWR file.
yy - Year.
nnnn - Sequence. This was originally 2 numbers, later changed to 4.
sss - Sender. 2 or 3 digits.
rrr - Receiver. 2 or 3 digits.
xx - Version of the CWR standard (version x.x).
