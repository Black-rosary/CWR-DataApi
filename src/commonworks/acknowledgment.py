    Represents a CWR Acknowledgment Transaction (ACK).

    This transaction is used by the recipient to indicate for each received transaction if it was accepted or not,
    adding any error or warning message that may have resulted from checking the file.

    The acknowledged transactions will be included inside this one.

    But not all transactions will be acknowledged, only AGR, NWR, REV or EXC transactions need acknowledgment, and
    these will be returned with a few changes, as the ACK transaction will contain all the records sent by
    the submitter that have relevance to the recipient.

    For example, a society will generally not return SPU/SPT records for sub-publishers in territories it does not
    control.

    The exception are NWR and REV transactions will be as the submitter sent, but supplemented with additional
    information such as CAE/IPI name numbers where possible. In particular, the use of controlled/non-controlled
    record types will be as for the submitter.  For example, if a submitter sent a publisher on an SPU, the ACK will
    contain an SPU for that publisher.

    All the messages caused by processing the records will be included in the ACK transaction along the acknowledged
    transaction.
